He cleaned my dirty closet\nand dusted with his tail.\n\nHe straightened out my posters\nand swept my wooden floor.\nMy parents almost fainted\nwhen he fixed my bedroom door.\n\nI did not try to stop him.\nHe made my windows shine.\nMy room looked like a palace,\nand my dresser smelled like pine.\n\nHe fluffed up every pillow.\nHe folded all my clothes.\nHe even cleaned my fish tank\nwith a toothbrush and a hose.\n\nI thought it was amazing\nto see him use a broom.\nI’m glad he ate my essay\non “How to Clean My Room.",
